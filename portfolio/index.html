        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p>In 2010, I recieved my A.S in Computer Information Systems from
          Luzerne County Community College. Upon graduating, I took a job at
          Mohegan Sun Pocono as a table games dealer. There, I learned how to professionally deal
          almost any game a casino has to offer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I moved to Boston MA in early 2019 for a full-time poker dealer
          position at Encore Boston Harbor where I learned exceptional
          customer service and communication skills. However, city life proved
          to be too stressful (and costly) for myself and my family so we moved
          back home in early 2020</p>
        <br>
        <p>When COVID struck and I got furloughed, I decided to take the opportunity to get back into the tech industry
          so I enrolled at Thinkful. I spent the next 6 months committing 60+ hours a week to learning and honing my new
          skills.
          I hope to obatain a remote Web Developer position so I can spend more time with my family.</p>

              class='port-img'></a>
          <p>This application was a project assigned to me during Thinkful's curriculum. It is a fictional adoption
            agency for
            cats and dogs.
            Users enter their name which puts them at the end of a Queue datastructure on the back end. A timer is then
            set and every five seconds the user at top of
            queue is removed and the top cat or dog (in their own seperate queues) is adopted and removed. When the user
            is next in line they will be given teh next dog and next cat available for adoption where they choose.
          </p><br>
          <p>Built using vanilla CSS, Javascript, ReactJs, NodeJs, ExpressJs, and also implements and manipulates a
            Queue data structure on server side.

          <h2>Spanish Spaced-Rep</h2>
          <a href='https://spaced-repetition.tomwallacejr.vercel.app'><img src='images/spacerep.png' alt='spacedrep'
              class='port-img'></a>
          <p>This application was my second capstone at Thinkful. It is a Spanish language learning application that
            uses the
            spaced-repetition learning technique. After registering for a new account, the user is directed to their
            dashboard which displays their current progress.
            In the Learning Route, one by one, Spanish words render to the screen and the user is prompted to enter the
            English translation
            of said word. It is built for anybody who would like to learn entry level Spanish.
          </p><br>
          <p>Developed using vanilla CSS, Javascript, ReactJs, NodeJs, ExpressJs, Knex and is connected to a PostgreSQL
            database deployed on Heroku.

          <h2>Dealer Tokes</h2>
          <a href='https://dealer-tokes-client.tomwallacejr.vercel.app/register'><img src='images/dealertokes.png'
              alt='dealertokes' class='port-img'></a>
          <p>Final Capstone Project at Thinkful. This Web Application is designed specifically for Poker Dealers. Dealer
            Tokes allows
            Poker Dealers to keep track of their total/daily income and keeps track of how much they are making per hour
            as well as per down over
            time. Upon registering, the user is directed to a Dashboard Route where an interactive calendar is rendered
            to the screen.
            By clicking a day on the calendar, a component renders below it and prompts the user for their results from
            said workday. The Statements
            route, displays how much the user has made to date, their hourly toke rate, and their toke rate per down. I
            am in the process of including
            monthly statements as well as a graphical representation of the users statistics over time.
            This application is my baby and I plan to expand and add numerous features to it overtime but it is LIVE
            now.
          </p><br>
          <p>I built the front end using vanilla CSS, Javascript, ReactJs, and is deployed on Vercel. The back end was
            built using NodeJs, ExpressJs,
            Knex and connects to a PSQL database deployed on Heroku.
