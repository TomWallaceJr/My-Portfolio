          <p>I am a software developer living in Wilkes-barre/Scranton PA, home of The Office and Old Forge Pizza!! Currently,
          I am attending a full-time Engineering Immersive Program at Thinkful. I've been
          happily married for seven years now and I am a proud father of a two year old boy.
          </p>

          <p>When I'm not at the computer, some of my interests include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Poker - I've spent a lot of time over the past decade playing in poker rooms up and down the east coast.</li>
            <li>Football - Avid Philadelphia Eagles fan for life.</li>
            <li>Traveling and the Outdoors - Anywhere and Everywhere!!</li>
            <li>Reading - Mostly non-fiction investing, finance, and technology books</li>
            <li>Bitcoin & Blockchain Technology - I strongly believe this new emerging tech has the power to change the world!</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>Career</h3>
              <p>In 2010, I recieved my A.S in Computer Information Systems from
                Luzerne County Community College. Upon graduating, I took a job at
                Mohegan Sun Pocono as a table games dealer. There, I learned how to professionally deal
                almost any game a casino has to offer.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Blackjack</li>
              <li>Poker</li>
              <li>Craps</li>
              <li>Roulette and more</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p>I moved to Boston MA in early 2019 for a full-time poker dealer
                position at Encore Boston Harbor where I learned exceptional
                customer service and communication skills. However, city life proved
                to be too stressful (and costly) for myself and my family so we moved
                back home in early 2020</p>
                <br>
              <p>I recently decided to quit my job at the casino and focus full time
                 on becoming a Software Engineer. The casino industry over the last 10 years has been good to me
                 for the most part, and it has been fun while it lasted, but it just
                 isn't the career I yearn for. I've always regretted not continuing
                 my education and getting a tech job so I decided to take a leap
                 of faith! By the end of this program, I hope to become a Full-stack Web Developer working from home so I can spend
                more time with my family. </p>
